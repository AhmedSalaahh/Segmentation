The dataset used originates from a German bank in 2016 and was collected by Professor Hoffman from the University of California. Each record in the dataset corresponds to an individual who obtained a loan from the bank.

This analysis aims to categorize the customers of the German bank using the different factors (variables) recorded in their database.

Kmeans Clustering with elbow method are used to get the suitable number of clusters for one variable or bivariables, multivariable clusters can be more investigated.
